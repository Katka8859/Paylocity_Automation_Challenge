Playwright project for Paylocity automation challenge. 
The project is divided into API tests and UI tests.
UI test contains - atomic tests, e2e tests, and modal window action test.
API tests contains - all API methods, including basic user flow and application calculations. 
User login details are stored in secrets. I can send them by email on request, or you can request them via Sue Stanley.
